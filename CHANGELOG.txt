DENYHOSTS CHANGELOG

0.6.0
=====

- Modified email message date/time format to be RFC-2822 compliant.  Incorporated patch contributed by Rick 
Holbert.

- Added reverse dns lookups and the HOSTNAME_LOOKUP for enabling/disabling them.  Incorporated feature 
request of Ron Joffe.

- Added additional config option (SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_REPORT_ALLOWED_HOSTS) for reporting (or not) 
suspicious login activity.  This feature is based on feedback from Ron Joffe.  

- Updated regex for matching non-existent user break-ins.  Previously, "invalid" was matched against.  
Now, both "invalid" and "illegal" should match.  This fix is based on email from Scott Hunziker.
