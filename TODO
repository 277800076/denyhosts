Debian bug 690524
When sshd passwordauthenication is turned off (key access only)
then DenyHost does not detect the denied log entry. This means
we are not blocking the remote host when multiple attempts are
made to access the local service. We should try to
detect bad connections to key-only systems.


See about making denyhost fork earlier to avoid "hanging" and being
stopped by systemd

Try to support Fedora's journal logging as an alternative to /var/log/secure

Support IPTables and PF firewall as alternative/addition to hosts.deny.
(Test IPTables)

In cases where DenyHosts cannot write to disk, it should not crash.

Consider support for IPv6

Create new sync server.
